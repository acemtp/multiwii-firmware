Firmware - GitHub mirror of the official SVN multiwii project
===

### Introduction:

The official development of [MultiWii](http://www.multiwii.com/) is stored in a [SVN](http://code.google.com/p/multiwii/source/browse/).

But we are more and more developer who want to use GitHub to develop multiwii that's why we created multiwii organization.

The goal of this organization is to federate and centralize the community effort.

This project is a mirror of the svn that is syncronized automatically. So you'll see every SVN commit with the commit author and comment.

It contains the firmware part of the multiwii project.

Feel free to fork this project to add your own modification.
